# Dissertation: Dating App Location Privacy

## Full Title

**"Danger From Zero Metres Away: Public Perceptions of the Safety, Risk and Misuse of Live-location-based Dating Applications"**

## Research Details

**Supervisor**: Laura Sibret  
**Institution**: University of Portsmouth  
**Programme**: BSc Criminology and Cybercrime  
**Expected Completion**: Summer 2026  
**Current Status**: Ethics approval obtained, survey design in progress

## Abstract

This dissertation examines public awareness and perception of safety risks in live-location-based dating applications, with particular focus on platforms like Grindr. The research investigates how users understand (or fail to understand) the criminal exploitation potential of real-time geolocation features, vulnerabilities in age verification systems, and the methods by which malicious actors can leverage location data for targeting.

Through mixed-methods survey research, this study bridges criminological theory and cybersecurity practice, analysing the temporal asymmetry between criminal adaptation to new technologies and institutional/user responses.

## Research Framework

### Theoretical Foundation

**Criminological Perspectives**:
- Routine Activity Theory applied to digital spaces
- Crime opportunity theory in technological contexts
- Risk perception and behavioural adaptation
- Temporal asymmetries in criminal vs. institutional adaptation

**Cybersecurity Analysis**:
- Technical vulnerabilities in geolocation systems
- Privacy implications of real-time location sharing
- Age verification system weaknesses
- Platform security architecture

### Research Questions

1. How aware are dating app users of location-based privacy and safety risks?
2. What vulnerabilities exist in age verification mechanisms for dating platforms?
3. How can criminal actors leverage geolocation data for targeting and exploitation?
4. What is the gap between actual risk and user risk perception?
5. How do users respond to safety warnings and privacy controls?

## Methodology

### Research Design
**Approach**: Mixed-methods survey research combining:
- Quantitative data on user awareness and behaviour
- Qualitative data on risk perception and concerns
- Comparative analysis across user demographics
- Technical assessment of platform security features

### Ethics and Compliance
- University ethics approval obtained
- Participant consent and data protection protocols
- Anonymous response collection
- Responsible handling of sensitive topics

### Target Population
- Current and former dating app users
- Non-users for comparative analysis
- Focus on awareness levels across demographics
- Geographic focus: UK-based respondents

## Key Themes

### Geolocation Vulnerability
Examining real-time location sharing risks:
- Location triangulation attacks
- Physical stalking and harassment potential
- Privacy violation vectors
- User awareness of technical capabilities

### Age Verification Failures
Investigating underage access vulnerabilities:
- Registration process weaknesses
- Identity verification gaps
- Platform accountability
- Regulatory compliance issues

### Criminal Exploitation Strategies
Analysing malicious use of location data:
- Victim identification and targeting
- Pattern analysis for criminal purposes
- Systematic harassment campaigns
- Exploitation of user trust

### Risk Communication
Assessing effectiveness of safety measures:
- User response to warnings
- Privacy control utilisation
- Behavioural change triggers
- Education and awareness gaps

## Preliminary Findings

*To be updated as research progresses*

Research is currently in survey design and ethics approval stages. Data collection will commence in early 2026.
