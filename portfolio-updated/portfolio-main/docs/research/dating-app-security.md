# Dating App Location Privacy: Dissertation Research

## Research Title

**"Danger From Zero Metres Away: Public Perceptions of the Safety, Risk and Misuse of Live-location-based Dating Applications"**

**Supervisor**: Laura Sibret  
**Status**: In Progress (Expected completion: 2026)  
**Methodology**: Mixed-methods survey research

## Research Overview

This dissertation examines the intersection of location-based technology, user privacy, and criminal exploitation in modern dating applications. The research focuses on public awareness of safety risks inherent in live geolocation features, particularly in applications like Grindr.

## Research Questions

The study investigates:

1. **Public Awareness**: How aware are users of the safety risks associated with live-location sharing in dating apps?
2. **Underage Access**: What vulnerabilities exist regarding age verification and underage user protection?
3. **Criminal Exploitation**: How can malicious actors leverage geolocation data for targeting and harassment?
4. **Risk Perception**: How do users perceive and respond to privacy and safety warnings?

## Methodology

### Survey Design
- Mixed-methods approach combining quantitative and qualitative data
- Target population: Dating app users and non-users
- Focus on perception vs. actual understanding of risks
- Ethics approval obtained through university review process

### Research Framework
The study employs criminological theory to analyse:
- Temporal asymmetries between criminal adaptation and institutional responses
- Routine activity theory applied to digital spaces
- Risk perception and behavioural change in technology use

## Key Focus Areas

### Geolocation Vulnerability
Examining how real-time location sharing creates opportunities for:
- Physical stalking and harassment
- Location triangulation attacks
- Targeted criminal activity
- Privacy violations

### Age Verification Gaps
Investigating weaknesses in:
- User registration processes
- Age verification mechanisms
- Underage access prevention
- Platform accountability

### Criminal Targeting Strategies
Analysing how location data enables:
- Victim identification and selection
- Pattern analysis for criminal purposes
- Exploitation of user trust
- Systematic harassment campaigns

## Broader Implications

This research contributes to understanding:

### Technology and Crime
- How emerging technologies create new criminal opportunities
- The gap between technological capability and user understanding
- Platform responsibility in user safety

### Policy Considerations
- Regulatory frameworks for location-based services
- Age verification requirements
- User protection standards
- Corporate accountability

### User Education
- Effective risk communication strategies
- Privacy literacy in dating app contexts
- Behavioural interventions for safer usage

## Skills Demonstrated

This dissertation showcases:
- Advanced research methodology design
- Ethics approval and responsible research conduct
- Criminological theory application to cyber contexts
- Mixed-methods data analysis
- Technical understanding of geolocation systems
- Academic writing and literature synthesis
