# Reversec UK Ltd - Security Research Internship

**Role**: Security Research Intern  
**Duration**: Summer 2025  
**Focus**: Microsoft Entra Connect exploitation research

## Internship Overview

Summer 2025 security research internship at Reversec UK Ltd, specialising in Microsoft Entra Connect (formerly Azure AD Connect) security analysis and exploitation technique development.

## Primary Research Focus

### Entra Connect Synchronisation Security
Conducted in-depth research into the security implications of Microsoft's hybrid identity synchronisation platform:

### Key Research Outcomes

**MSOL Credential Extraction**:
- Successfully extracted Microsoft Online (MSOL) service account credentials from Entra Connect servers
- Demonstrated privilege escalation paths from on-premises to cloud environments
- Documented systematic extraction methodology for security testing

**DCSync Attack Execution**:
- Performed DCSync attacks to obtain domain credentials
- Demonstrated lateral movement opportunities in hybrid identity environments
- Mapped attack chains from initial access to full domain compromise

**Modern Tooling Development**:
- Created Graph API-based scripts replacing deprecated AADInternals functionality
- Developed reliable, maintainable exploitation tools
- Produced comprehensive technical documentation for security testing
